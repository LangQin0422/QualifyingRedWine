# QualifyingRedWine
___
## Project Preview
The goal of this work is to develop regression models to qualifying red wine based on 11 quantitative
features of wine. This work implements three regression models: 1) least sqaures regression, 2) kernel
regression using Gaussian (RBF) kernel, and 3) kernel regression using Laplacian kernel. This work consists
of three sub-tasks in order to achieve the goal: 1) normalize input data to fit the model, 2) develop and
evaluate each regression model, and 3) use the fitted model to predict the quality of the batch of 5 new
wines.
